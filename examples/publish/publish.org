#+title: Example setup for publishing with org-ref

Here is a short setup to publish files in [[./src/]] to html and pdf format using org-publish and org-ref. Adapted from code contributed by Madhu.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(load-file "../../org-ref-publish.el")
				      
;; set up this async init file if you want asynchronous publishing
(setq org-export-async-init-file (expand-file-name "async-init.el"))

(require 'ox)
(setq org-publish-use-timestamps-flag nil)
(setq org-export-async-debug t)

;; HTML target
(org-publish '("src files"
	       :base-directory "./src"
	       :publishing-function org-ref-publish-to-html
	       :publishing-directory "./build"
	       :section-numbers nil)
	     'async)

;; PDF target
(org-publish '("src files"
	       :base-directory "./src"
	       :publishing-function org-ref-publish-to-pdf
	       :publishing-directory "./build"
	       :section-numbers nil)
	     'async)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

You can use  M-x org-export-stack to inspect the results after calling org-publish.
